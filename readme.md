# Mike's static scaffold
This is what I make sites with.
Jade templates, Less for CSS, gulp-connect for a reloading server. That's it.

## Steps

1. Clone into a directory
2. cd into the directory
3. ` npm install `
4. ` gulp ` default task builds the `dist` folder
5. ` gulp watch ` starts the watcher and the gulp-connect server on 8080
6. Start editing Less and templates

## Todo

* Bootstrap?
* Routing?
